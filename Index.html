        <p class="sec2">Airplane, also called aeroplane or plane, any of a class of fixed-wing aircraft that is heavier than air, <br> 
            propelled by a screw propeller or a high-velocity jet, and supported by the dynamic reaction of the air against its wings. <br>
            For an account of the development of the airplane and the advent of civil aviation see history of flight. <br>
           <br>The essential components of an airplane are a wing system to sustain it in flight, tail surfaces to stabilize the wings, <br>
            movable surfaces to control the attitude of the plane in flight, <br> and a power plant to provide the thrust necessary to push the vehicle through the air. <br>
            Provision must be made to support the plane when it is at rest on the ground and during takeoff and landing. <br> Most planes feature an enclosed body (fuselage) to house the crew, passengers, 
            and cargo; <br> the cockpit is the area from which the pilot operates the controls and instruments to fly the plane.</p>

        <h2 id="sec4">Principles of an Aeroplane, Flight and Operation</h2>
        <p id="sec5">An aircraft in straight-and-level unaccelerated flight has four forces acting on it. (In turning, diving, or climbing flight, <br> additional forces come into play.) 
            These forces are lift, an upward-acting force; <br> drag, a retarding force of the resistance to lift and to the friction of the aircraft moving through the air; 
          <br>weight, the downward effect that gravity has on the aircraft; and thrust, <br> the forward-acting force provided by the propulsion system (or, in the case of unpowered aircraft, 
           <br> by using gravity to translate altitude into speed). <br> Drag and weight are elements inherent in any object, including an aircraft. 
           <br> Lift and thrust are artificially created elements devised to enable an aircraft to fly.
          <br>  Understanding lift first requires an understanding of an airfoil, <br> which is a structure designed to obtain reaction upon its surface from the air through which it moves. <br>
            Early airfoils typically had little more than a slightly curved upper surface and a flat undersurface. <br> Over the years, airfoils have been adapted to meet changing needs. 
           <br> By the 1920s, airfoils typically had a rounded upper surface, <br> with the greatest height being reached in the first third of the chord (width). 
           <br> In time, both upper and lower surfaces were curved to a greater or lesser degree, <br> and the thickest part of the airfoil gradually moved backward. 
           <br> As airspeeds grew, there was a requirement for a very smooth passage of air over the surface, <br> which was achieved in the laminar-flow airfoil, 
            where the camber was farther back than contemporary practice dictated. <br> Supersonic aircraft required even more drastic changes in airfoil shapes, 
           <br> some losing the roundness formerly associated with a wing and having a double-wedge shape.</p>
